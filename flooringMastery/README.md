Approach

- Reading through the user stories, creating the spring application with maven using https://start.spring.io/
- Create the packages (DTO, DAO, Service, Controller, View) for the MVC design approach 
- Create the menu selection in the view package, similar style to the class rooster example
- Set up the UserIO interface and the UserIOConsoleImpl class which implements the UserIO interface
- Set up the controller which controls when the menu system is displayed. 
- Set up the DTOs for Product, Tax and Order
- Set up the DAOs for Product, Tax and Order and also the DAOfile implementation that implements the DAO objects
- Create the exceptions to account for no orders and data validation 
- Check that the application file is set to run from the controller
- Set up the test folder
